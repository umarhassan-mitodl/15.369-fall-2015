Designing the Entrepreneurial Organization. Leadership and the Role of the Executive
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
There are ongoing debates about how executives can best make the existing large organization more entrepreneurial. Using The Clorox Company as a case study we will address the enterprise-level challenges and the practical changes necessary in leadership and design that enabled them to become more innovative. There will be an opportunity for the class to analyze and improve upon the thinking and actions of the firm and to explore how some of the tools and methods being researched in your term papers might have been applicable.

Accelerating new business growth: The external tools and methods that can be employed by a firm
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}
In an effort to accelerate growth, many firms often turn to open innovation, acquisitions, or joint ventures. Furthermore, to increase the growth of a new business, the firm may spin it off rather than keep it inside the firm. However, if these strategies are not effectively implemented, they often slow rather than speed up the growth of new businesses. In this session, we consider how managers can ensure that acceleration, rather than deceleration, is the outcome.
